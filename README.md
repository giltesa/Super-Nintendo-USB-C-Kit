# Super Nintendo: USB-C Kit

The **Super Nintendo: USB-C Kit** is a board that allows to replace the original power connector for a modern and standard USB-C.

**If your original connector is too old or damaged** and you need a new one, or **if you would like to power up your Super Nintendo with a standard USB-C charger**, such as the charger for your **Nintendo Switch**, phone, or laptop, you can do so with this kit.

Moreover, with this board, **you can remove the original, old, and inefficient power converter**. Since the console operates at 5V, you only need the power from USB-C and a regular charger.
